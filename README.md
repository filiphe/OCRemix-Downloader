# OCREMIX downloader
This is a small python script to download the 10 latest remixes from www.ocremix.org.
It is *heavily* based on the [OverClocked ReMix Downloader](https://github.com/rmondello/OverClocked-ReMix-Downloader) repository, written in Ruby.
This was done primarily because I wanted to try new things with Python, and this seemed like a fittingly sized project.
